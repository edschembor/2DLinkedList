This repsository is for a "2d Linked List" data structure. Essentially, each
time an element is added, there is a chanve that another identical element will
be placed "on top of it" with pointers. This allows for quicker operations.
In theory, on each level, every other element will have an object above it.
See results.txt for more in depth explanation of efficiency.
