Part 2:

The average number of steps for each case is significantly lower than those in project 2. This is because the "leveling" in project 3 allow for much faster searching.

In project 3, for any set of range "n", we can expect there to be log(n) levels. Also, since we are using p = 50, then on average, for each level, every other element will a have a "copy" on an uppper level. Therefore, on average, the total amount of steps needed to complete a search will be 2log(n) since on average the program needs to move down once and move right once.

Part 3:

On average, p = 50 is the most efficient case. This is because for it, on avergae, every other element on any given level will have another copy of it on the next level. 
In the case of p = 25, on average, every fourth element will have a copy on a higher level. So, on average, the program will need to move down once and right 3 times on each level. So, for p = 25, the expected steps will be 4log(n).
In the case of p = 75, on average, 3 out of every 4 elements will have a copy on a higher level. So, on average, the program will need to move down 3 times and move right once on each level. So, for p = 25, the expected steps is 4log(n).
